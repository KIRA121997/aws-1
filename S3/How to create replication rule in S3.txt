Replication rule - 1.> for backup purpose
		       2.> we can easily share our docs in our diffrent offices in diffrent region 


Step 1 - create 2 buckets with "Bucket Versioning - Enabled" & "Object Lock - Disabled"

Step 2 - we have to create replication rule only on 1 bucket, so go to bucket 1 >> Management >> create replication rule >> Replication rule name >> Status - Enabled 
	   >> Source Bucket - Apply to all objects in the bucket >> Destination >> IAM role - Create new role or try to use existing one.

Step 3 - upload some file to bucket 1 then it will automatically create replica in bucket 2.
