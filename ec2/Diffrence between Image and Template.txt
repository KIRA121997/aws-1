Diffrence between Image and Template:-

Image = 1. exact copy of the software (only)
	  2. while, launching instacne we have to go through from stage 2-stage 7, we have to compelete these all stages.
	  3. we can customized AMI image as per our specification.

Template = 1. somewhat exact copy of the hardware (no software)s
	      2. while, launching instacne here, we don't have to go from all 7 stages, we can able to launch our instance directly from templates.
	      3. we can't able to customized AMI image as per our choice.
