1.Set Boundary

>> Create policy with "IAMfullaccess" >>> attached to the IAM user.
>> Set Permission Boundary :- again create one more policy in SetPermissoinBoundary
	(I want to set only one permission to IAM user that permission is "only policy creation") 

____create SetPermissoinBoundary policy with service IAM
    (List:FULL, Read:GetPolicy,GetUserPolicy, Permission Management:CreatePolicy,PutGroupPolicy, Resources:ALL)
>> Attached this new policy to IAM user and try to access it.


(Note:- Here we set 2 policies in one IAM user 1p is IAMfullAccess & 2p is setboundarypolicy __onlycreatepolicy_)
