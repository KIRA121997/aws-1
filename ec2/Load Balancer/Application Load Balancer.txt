Application Load Balancer:-

1. it is based on 7th layer of OSI model.
2. it helps to route traffic "based on tha path" that we will typing in url section .
3. it is one of the type of extended web server.
4. it will route user's request according to user's needed path.
5. by default it will accept HTTP & HTTPS.
6. we can easily add or remove target group from load balancers without disrupting of your instances and load balancers.




Step 1 - firstly we have to create 2 instances for laptop.

scripts-

#!/bin/bash
yum update all -y
yum install httpd -y
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "hello world, welcome to my laptop page $HOSTNAME" >> /var/www/html/index.html 

--security group- Add security group with SSH with HTTP



Step 2 - we have to create 2 instances for mobile.

script:

#!/bin/bash
yum update all -y
yum install httpd -y
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
mkdir -p /var/www/html/mobile/
echo "hello world, welcome to my mobile page $HOSTNAME" >> /var/www/html/mobile/index.html 

--security group- Add security group with SSH with HTTP


Step 3 - we have to create 2 instances for tab.

script:

#!/bin/bash
yum update all -y
yum install httpd -y
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
mkdir -p /var/www/html/tab/
echo "hello world, welcome to my tab page $HOSTNAME" >> /var/www/html/tag/index.html 

--security group- Add security group with SSH with HTTP

"All instances ready"



Step 4 - "create all 3 target group for mobile, laptop, tab"

	we can attach target group to the { Instance, IP Address, Lambda Function, Application Load Balancer }



Step 5 - Create Application Load Balancer >> Load Balancer name >> "scheme- internate facing" >> ipv4 >> "Network Mapping"-  attach default VPC >> "Mapping"- select availability zone according to instances (our servers) 
		>> add default securty group >> create >> wait for in healthy state.

Step 6 - go to load balacner >> lister >> view and edit rules >> if {Path is/mobile*} >> forwarded to we created "target group".

Step 7 -  copy&paste Applciation laod balancer DNS >> /mobile/ >> /tab/ 

Step 8 - ................./mobile/ /tab/ /laptop/
