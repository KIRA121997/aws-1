steps to create CLASSIC LOAD BALANCER:-

step 1 - firstly create 3 instance with bash script and HTTP port in scurity group.

a. script:-
	
#!/bin/bash
yum update all -y
yum install httpd -y
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "hello world, welcome to $HOSTNAME" >> /var/www/html/index.html 

b. scurity group:- add http port / custom:- anywhere

step 2 - check where all public running or not or our html page hitting or not.

step 3 - create "Load Balancer- classic load balancer" >> enable advance VPC >> select subnet "according your instance"

step 4 - "Assign security group" >> add security group according to our instance >>

step 5 - health check

step 6 - "Add ec2 instance" >> select all 3 running instances, where html page created >>

step 7 - Add Tags

step 8 -  Review.

step 9 - wait for load balancer goes in service.

step 10 - copy&paste DNS in incognito mode and check wheather all html page working or not with "refreshin 3 time a tab" 


:::Types of load balancer:-

1. Classic Load Balancer
2. Application Load Balancer
3. Network Load Balancer
4. Gateway Load Balancer


Concepts of load balancer:-

1s. Round Robin- round robin one sub-type of classic load balancer, it will distribute users request to instances according to sequencialy cyclic round with.
2. Least connection- In least connection all users request traffic goes towards "healthy state" of instances, where less amount of user are connected ot that instances.
3. Least time- In least time, it depends on instancce type--> high configuration instance will get high "response time from that instance" and required "few active connection on that instance".
4. Over flow- In over flow concept, will decide capacity of that instance, will decide percentage(%) of perticular instance, when perticular instance capacity will overflowed then it will automatically switch to another instance.
